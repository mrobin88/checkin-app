| Month | Users | Revenue | Costs | Profit |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 3 | 500 | $200 | $0 | $200 |
| 6 | 2,000 | $800 | $0 | $800 |

## Competitive Advantage

### vs. Foursquare:
- ✅ Simpler, faster
- ✅ Better mobile UX
- ✅ Instant friend adding
- ✅ Focus on social, not reviews

### vs. Yelp:
- ✅ Social-first (not business-first)
- ✅ Real-time activity
- ✅ Friend recommendations
- ✅ Less cluttered

### vs. Google Maps:
- ✅ Social layer
- ✅ Gamification
- ✅ Community, not just navigation

**Unique Value:** Mix of social networking + location discovery

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Low user adoption
**Mitigation:** Start hyper-local, focus on one community first

### Risk: No business interest in paid features
**Mitigation:** Free tier has value, pivot to consumer premium

### Risk: Competitors copy
**Mitigation:** Move fast, build community, focus on UX

### Risk: Technical scaling issues
**Mitigation:** Supabase scales to 50k users free, then $25/mo

**Overall Risk Level:** LOW (free to run, easy to iterate)

---

## Investment Opportunity

If seeking funding:

### Ask: $50,000 seed
**Use:**
- $30k marketing (paid ads, influencers)
- $15k development (hire contractor for features)
- $5k operations (hosting, tools)

### Offering: 10-20% equity
### Valuation: $250k-500k pre-money
### Exit Strategy: Acquisition by Yelp/Google/Meta ($5-50M)

### Traction Needed:
- 10,000 active users
- $2,000 MRR
- 20%+ monthly growth

**Fundable in 6-9 months with execution.**

---

## Team Requirements

### Now (Solo):
- You can manage everything
- 5-10 hours/week maintenance
- Focus: user acquisition

### At 1,000 Users:
- Still soloable
- Consider contractor for big features
- 10-15 hours/week

### At 5,000 Users:
- Hire part-time: Customer support
- Optional: Marketing person
- Still <$2k/month cost

### At 10,000+ Users:
- Full-time team of 2-3
- Engineer, marketer, support
- Revenue should cover costs + profit

---

## Technology Moat

### Easy to Copy:
- The code (it's just React + Supabase)
- The features (standard check-in app)
- The design (clean but not unique)

### Hard to Copy:
- Your network effects (users bring friends)
- Your local business relationships
- Your user data (venue recommendations)
- Your brand (first-mover in your city)

**Defense:** Move fast, build community, own your local market

---

## Exit Scenarios

### Lifestyle Business:
- $5,000-10,000 MRR
- Part-time work
- No outside funding
- **Timeline:** 12-18 months

### Acquisition Target:
- 100,000+ users
- $20,000+ MRR
- Strong engagement metrics
- **Timeline:** 2-3 years
- **Likely buyers:** Yelp, Google, Meta, Snap
- **Estimated value:** $5-50M

### Venture-Backed:
- Raise Series A at $5M valuation
- Scale nationally
- Go for $100M+ exit
- **Timeline:** 4-5 years
- **Risk:** Higher (need to keep growing)

**Recommended:** Start as lifestyle business, keep options open

---
